# NeuroMyelin-G-Ratio-Analysis-Toolkit
A Python-based application designed to streamline post-segmentation analysis of the g-ratio—a key metric for assessing axon–myelin integrity in the central nervous system—through an intuitive GUI tailored for users with no programming background.
If Python is already installed on your system, simply run the main.py file to launch the application, following the tutorial and the user manual.
Don't have Python installed or prefer not to install it; Use the portable version instead: https://uofi.box.com/s/501nt4ptrnje43bmial0r1jrwa31ndfx
