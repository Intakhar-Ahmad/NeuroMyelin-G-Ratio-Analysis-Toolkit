MyeliMetric:

MyeliMetric is an open-source toolkit, developed using the Python platform. It provides a streamlined, validated pipeline for post-segmentation analysis of the g-ratio—a vital metric for assessing myelin sheath thickness relative to axon diameter. Traditional g-ratio workflows often suffer from statistical inconsistencies and a lack of standardization, which can compromise scientific conclusions.

Getting Started

Option 1: Already have Python installed? Download 'Myelimetic_Scripts.zip'

Simply run the install_dependencies.py and then the main.py script to launch the application.
Before starting, make sure to read the Read_Me_First document included in the zipped folder.
You can also follow the detailed user manual.

**Option 2:** 
No Python installed? No problem.
**Portable (Windows Ver only) — No Installation Needed**: [Download the 3 ZIP files📦](https://uofi.app.box.com/folder/348746175679), **Then unzip  (Portable Python, Scripts, and Data). First, run Thonny in the portable-Python folder and  then open the main.py file through Thonny stored in the Scripts folder**. Run it following the instruction Manual
**All dependencies are preloaded, and include an example dataset (`My_CTL`, `My_EXP`) plus subsequently generated data and folders. When you generate your data, the sample files will be overwritten (you’ll be asked for permission). It was tested on Windows 10/11 (64-bit).** 🎥 Don’t forget to watch the YouTube video tutorial for a step-by-step guide to run it.


Option 3: GraphPad Prism-no Python needed
If you prefer working in GraphPad Prism (v9+), we have provided a ready-to-use g-ratio analysis pipeline—download the Prism project files, open them in Prism, replace the demo tables with your data (match the example headers), run the saved analyses, and export figures as PNG/TIFF/PDF.
