# NeuroMyelin-G-Ratio-Analysis-Toolkit
The g-ratio—a critical metric for assessing myelin integrity—is often prone to errors due to flawed statistical assumptions in conventional analysis workflows. To overcome this, we developed MyeliMetric, an open-source Python-based toolbox that standardizes g-ratio analysis and significantly improves its accuracy.

This toolkit features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), making it accessible even for users with no or limited programming experience. It simplifies post-segmentation analysis of axon and myelin measurements, providing a clear, structured, and reproducible workflow for neuroscientists.
