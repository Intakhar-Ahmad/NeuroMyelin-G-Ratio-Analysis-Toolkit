MyeliMetric:

MyeliMetric is an open-source toolkit, developed using the Python platform. It provides a streamlined, validated pipeline for post-segmentation analysis of the g-ratioâ€”a vital metric for assessing myelin sheath thickness relative to axon diameter. Traditional g-ratio workflows often suffer from statistical inconsistencies and a lack of standardization, which can compromise scientific conclusions.

Getting Started

Option 1: Already have Python installed? Download 'Myelimetic_Scripts.zip'

Simply run the install_dependencies.py and then the main.py script to launch the application.
Before starting, make sure to read the Read_Me_First document included in the zipped folder.
You can also follow the detailed user manual.

**Option 2:** 
No Python installed? No problem.
**Portable (Windows Ver only) â€” No Installation Needed**: [Download the ZIP fileðŸ“¦](https://uofi.box.com/s/6479js3utghw4kz4iga1i1xdy2k2o5sr), **Portable Then unzip and run it following the instruction Manual.**
**All dependencies are preloaded, and include an example dataset (`My_CTL`, `My_EXP`) plus subsequently generated data and folders. When you generate your data, the sample files will be overwritten (youâ€™ll be asked for permission). It was tested on Windows 10/11 (64-bit).** ðŸŽ¥ Donâ€™t forget to watch the YouTube video tutorial for a step-by-step guide to run it.


Option 3: GraphPad Prism-no Python needed
If you prefer working in GraphPad Prism (v9+), we have provided a ready-to-use g-ratio analysis pipelineâ€”download the Prism project files, open them in Prism, replace the demo tables with your data (match the example headers), run the saved analyses, and export figures as PNG/TIFF/PDF.
