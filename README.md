ðŸ§  MyeliMetric: NeuroMyelin G-Ratio Analysis Toolkit
MyeliMetric is an open-source toolkit built in Python that provides a streamlined, validated pipeline for post-segmentation analysis of the g-ratioâ€”a vital metric for assessing myelin sheath thickness relative to axon diameter. Traditional g-ratio workflows often suffer from statistical inconsistencies and a lack of standardization, which can compromise scientific conclusions.
